<h1>All players start up with a queen ant, 6 worker ants, 3 soldier ants and 3 sugar cubes. The goal of the game is to take the thrones of all other players by standing on them for 3 turns.
<br>
<img class="board" src="/img/board_concept2.png" alt="Question" width="500px" >
<br>
  To do so you have to gather by standing on an adjacent tile to the sugar cube(s) you want to pick up or on one of the gathering spots shown on the board. You can use the sugar cubes to spawn new worker ants, which costs 2 cubes for 1 ant spawn (it's not possible if the queen is dead), or merge already existing ones into higher tier units, which costs 1 sugar cube and 2 units of the previous tier (only when the previous tier ants are in the hive). Only worker ants are able to gather and they have to bring the sugar cube to their hive for you to collect it (a single ant is able to pick up a cube only once per turn but can stack multiple on them). If they are defeated while holding sugar cubes then they will drop them where the ants were standing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game is turn based - you have 20 action points (AP) per turn. Moving to an adjacent tile, attacking with 1 pawn, gathering 1 sugar cube and spawning/merging ants cost 1 action point each and it is up to you to decide how to use them. After one turn cycle (after all players have had their turns once) a special effect should be cast by rolling a dice.
  <br>
  <br>
  When you want to attack, you can either use a single or more pawns. Each pawn has a tier and every tier has a different power level (more info in the table below). When you attack all enemies in a 3×3 area around the pawn you are using to attack will be affected. Yours and the target’s power levels are compared and the side with the highest wins. When there are multiple enemy pawns in reach, their attacks are summed and after that compared to yours. If you want to attack with multiple pawns make sure that the target is in reach of all your pawns - in this case the power levels of all your troops are summed, but it will cost more AP (-1 for every pawn attacking). If the power levels are the same then both sides die.
