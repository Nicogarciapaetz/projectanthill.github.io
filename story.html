        <h1>Story</h1>
        <h2>For years the great ant colony led by the queen regnant ruled over Mr. Smithâ€™s backyard. All the ants lived in serenity under her rule.<br> Unfortunately, one day her majesty passed away, there was mass confusion, the law states that in case of the death of a ruler, her title should be given unto the firstborn larva, however in this situation there were multiple firstborns as they were quadruplets.<br> Unable to decide the next queen, they began fighting each other thus causing anarchy within the colony. The only solution was to separate the colony into 4 separate hives, each ruled by one of the heirs.<br> The plan seemed to work, though not until the Great Drought set upon the lands, that has depleted the resources of the hives.<br> Now we are in the beginning of a major war that is going to decide the fate of the once united colony.</h2>
